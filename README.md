## Spam Email Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam. The goal is to develop an effective spam filter that can help in identifying and segregating unwanted emails, enhancing the overall email management experience.

### Project Overview

Spam emails are a common issue in digital communication, often leading to phishing attacks, malware, and unwanted advertisements. This project aims to address this problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to create a robust spam detection system using the `RandomForestClassifier`.

### Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes publicly available email datasets containing labeled spam and non-spam emails.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes text normalization, tokenization, stop-word removal, and other necessary preprocessing steps to prepare the email data for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other relevant methods to convert textual data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Uses `RandomForestClassifier` to train the model on the preprocessed data for email classification.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using the `score` and `predict` methods from the `RandomForestClassifier`.
